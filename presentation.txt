The Problem Statement: many people overlook their mental well-being. Without a structured approach to tracking emotional states and reflecting on daily moods, it becomes challenging to recognize patterns that influence personal growth and mental health. Traditional journaling methods often lack the analysis and insights needed to gauge emotional progress over time.

The Solution: Reflectra is a command-line interface (CLI) application designed to help users track their daily moods, log journal entries, and analyze mood patterns over time. This application promotes self-awareness and personal growth, aiding users in tracking their moods and reflecting on their emotional journeys.

MVP Features:

User Registration and Authentication: Users can create a new account, view their account information, update details such as their name or email, and delete their account, which removes all associated data.

Daily Mood Logging: Users can add new journal entries with their mood and notes, view past entries, edit them if necessary, and delete old or unwanted entries.

View Journal Entries: Users can list all their journal entries organized by date for easy viewing and reflection.

Mood Pattern Analysis: The app analyzes mood trends based on past entries, helping users identify significant emotional fluctuations over time.

Technical Expectations: The project is built using Python, SQLAlchemy for the database management, and features a command-line interface.

Database Structure:

User Table: This stores user details with fields for id, name, email, and password.
Journal Entry Table: This stores daily journal entries, including fields for id, user_id, date, mood, and notes.
Mood Pattern Table: This table summarizes mood pattern analyses for users, with fields for id, user_id, start_date, end_date, and mood_trend.
Relationships: There is a one-to-many relationship between the User and Journal Entry tables, as well as between the User and Mood Pattern tables, allowing a user to have multiple entries and patterns analyzed over time.

Demonstration: [If possible, I will now demonstrate the Reflectra application. I will walk you through the registration process, mood logging, and mood analysis features, highlighting key functionalities and the user experience.]

Conclusion: In summary, Reflectra aims to help users track their moods and reflect on their emotional journeys through a user-friendly CLI application. I am looking forward to future improvements and additional features that could enhance the user experience.
